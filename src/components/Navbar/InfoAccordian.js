            Open Meta is a platform for creating meta-analyses from tens to
            millions of studies easily. It is the platform for researchers and
            statisticians to find grounded scientific truth based on statistical
            analysis. For information on what meta analyses are:

            To start, create an account on the Open Meta platform. Meta-analyses
            creation on Open Meta is based on two important parts: the
            Collection and the Analyses. The Collection is the collection of
            studies you want to create a Meta-Analysis for. Open Meta aggregates
            data from millions of studies available on the web. Next, the
            Anlysis is the meta-analyses which aggregates your collection data.
